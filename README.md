# Movie Recommendation System

## Problem Statement :

In today’s digital entertainment landscape, users are bombarded with a wide variety of movies, making it challenging to discover films that match their preferences. A movie recommendation system can help users navigate this vast collection by predicting and suggesting movies they are likely to enjoy based on their historical behavior, preferences, and the behavior of other users with similar tastes.

## Objective:
To develop a movie recommendation system using machine learning algorithms that accurately predicts and recommends movies to users based on their preferences, viewing history, and ratings. The system should be capable of handling large datasets and providing personalized suggestions for each user.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Explore and preprocess movie data from TMDb.
- **Recommendation Algorithms**: Implement various algorithms to generate movie recommendations.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies similar to those a user has liked based on movie attributes.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Suggests movies based on the preferences of similar users.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines multiple recommendation techniques for improved accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from TMDb and includes the following features:
- `movie_id`: Unique identifier for each movie.
- `title`: Title of the movie.
- `overview`: Brief description of the movie.
- `release_date`: Release date of the movie.
- `genres`: Genres associated with the movie.
- `vote_average`: Average rating of the movie.
- `vote_count`: Number of votes the movie has received.
- `popularity`: Popularity score of the movie.
- `cast`: Main cast members of the movie.
- `crew`: Key crew members of the movie.

## Key Requirements:
**User Preferences :** The system should take into account user-specific data, such as movie ratings, genres of interest, and watch history, to provide tailored recommendations.

**Collaborative Filtering :** Implement collaborative filtering techniques to leverage user interaction data, finding patterns in user behavior to suggest movies that similar users have enjoyed.

**Content-Based Filtering :** Use movie metadata (e.g., genre, director, cast) to recommend movies with similar characteristics to those a user has liked in the past.

**Hybrid Approach :** Combine collaborative and content-based filtering for a more robust and accurate recommendation model.

**Scalability :** The system should be able to handle large-scale datasets with thousands of users and movies while maintaining efficiency and accuracy.

**Cold Start Problem :** Develop strategies to handle new users or movies with little to no prior data.




## Expected Outcome:
A machine learning-based movie recommendation system that continuously learns and improves based on user interactions, delivering personalized movie suggestions and enhancing the overall user experience.
